<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
Most often, owners give same attention to all of the plants in their garden (eg: watering, fertilization etc..). Although it is good in most cases, but some plants need special care and more attention. Also, the environment demands the owner to make informed decisions to ensure maximum results. 

This project aims to provide a solution for the owner to manage the lifecycle of each and every plant in the garden uniquely. The web application will maintain separate models for the type of garden ( eg. flowering vs fruit yielding) in the Postgres database. The project will incorporate all of the requirements mentioned in the assignment for this project.

Key features of the game include:
* Interesting
* Encourages to learn spelling
* Develops mental process

## Built With
 
The game is developed using the following:
* CSS
* React Javascript library
* Java
* SpringBoot RESTFUL API
* PostgressSQL

## Getting Started

To play the game;

### Prerequisites
1. Visual Studio 
2. Chrome (Version 89.0.4389.128 or later)
3. Eclipse
4. NPM
5. Insomania

### Installation
Clone the Git repository to your local system <br>

```bash
    git clone https://github.com/anbu-j/Project_3
```

## Usage
The application will consist of a simple Spring Boot RESTful API and a user interface (UI) implemented with the React JavaScript library.This is creating an application capable of creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting (CRUD) different types of plants in graden.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
